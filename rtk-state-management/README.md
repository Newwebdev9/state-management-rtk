I. Overview
The "Add New Product" form provides a user-friendly interface for inputting product details, including name, description, pricing, stock availability, category, and images. It leverages React, Redux Toolkit for state management, Formik and Yup for form handling and validation, and styled-components for styling.  The form is designed to be responsive and accessible.
II. Features
 * Responsive Design: Adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes using CSS Grid and Flexbox.
 * Real-time Validation: Utilizes Yup for schema-based validation, providing immediate feedback to the user.
 * State Management: Employs Redux Toolkit to manage the form data and product list globally.
 * Image Upload: Supports uploading multiple product images with preview functionality.
 * Controlled Inputs: All form inputs are controlled components, ensuring data consistency.
 * Dark Mode Support: Offers a toggle to switch between light and dark themes.
 * Submission Handling:  Handles form submission, dispatches Redux actions to update the product list, and can be extended for API integration.
 * Accessibility: Designed with accessibility in mind, incorporating ARIA attributes and labels.
III. Technical Stack
 * React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
 * Redux Toolkit:  A suite of tools for writing Redux logic.
 * Formik:  A library for building forms in React.
 * Yup: A schema-building and validation library.
 * styled-components:  A library for styling React components using CSS-in-JS.
IV. Component Structure
The form is composed of several key components:
 * ProductForm: The main form component, responsible for rendering the form, handling submissions, and managing validation.
 * Input (Custom): A styled input component for text and number inputs.
 * Select (Custom): A styled select component for dropdown menus.
 * ImageUpload (Custom): A component for handling image uploads and previews.

VIII. State Management (Redux Toolkit)
The form data and the list of products are managed using Redux Toolkit. The productSlice handles the state updates.  The addProduct action is dispatched upon successful form submission to add the new product to the global product list.
IX. Submission Handling
On form submission, the handleSubmit function is called. It performs the following actions:
 * Validates the form data using Yup.
 * If valid, dispatches the addProduct action to update the Redux store.
 * (Optional) Makes an API call to persist the data to a backend server (example provided in code).
 * Resets the form for the next input.
 * Displays a success message to the user.
X. Styling
The form is styled using styled-components.  Theming is implemented to support both light and dark modes.
XI. Accessibility
The form is designed with accessibility in mind, including:
 * Appropriate labels for all form elements.
 * ARIA attributes for dynamic elements and error messages.
 * Keyboard navigation support.
XII. Future Improvements
 * Enhanced Image Handling: Implement image editing and cropping features.
 * More Complex Validation: Add more validation rules as needed.
 * Backend Integration: Fully integrate with a backend API for data persistence.
 * Testing: Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests.
